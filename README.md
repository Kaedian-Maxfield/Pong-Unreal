# Unreal Engine C++ Pong Game
This is a really basic pong game made using Unreal Engine 4.19 and C++.
The idea behind it is to practice everything i learned in the third section of the *The Unreal Engine Developer Course*.

## Features:
- Ball moves around using the engines physics system.
- You can play against the AI (~~dont expect a big challenge lol~~).
- 8 bit sounds!
- I think it looks kinda good?

## Things that i think are worth mentioning / Things i learned:
- Pointers are amazing, but can give you hell if you don't use them safely.
- How to setup a static camera.
- How to code some basic AI.
- LOG EVERYTHING. DOESN'T MATTER, LOG THAT YOU LOGGED SOMETHING.
- Playing sounds at locations are fun.
- Resize TriggerBoxes shouldn't take that long. Use TriggerVolume instead.

## Things that would improve the game:
- Ball should bounce with a different angle depending of where it hit the paddle.
- The paddle's speed should increase so it can keep up with the ball.
- User Interface, lmao.

## Why didn't you do X thing Y way?
Uhhh... I probably don't have the knowledge to do this way, **yet**. The way i've done things in this game are the best ones i could come up with. I really tried to make the ball go for a different location depending of where it hit the paddle, for example, but i couldn't wrap my head about angles and shit.
